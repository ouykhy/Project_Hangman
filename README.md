## Project Description
We programmed the hangman game which interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources we have learned during the week.

## Rules
One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking one letter at a time. However, every wrong guess brings them closer to losing.

## Workflow
First, we needed to get the secret word input, then one letter at a time and check against the secret word. If is a correct letter, it gets displayed but if not then it counts as an error out of the 5 allowed.

## Organization
We used JIRA for project planning and for flowchart drawing.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
